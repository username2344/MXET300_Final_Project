# MXET300_Final_Project
This is the software side of the totally-not-a-roomba project

The goal of this project is to create a cleaning robot. This robot would have a starting point or “charging station” where it begins cleaning.
The robot will go around the room and clean in non-overlapping lines while avoiding walls and obstacles. 
The robot will map the room and return to the places it missed due to people or non-static obstacles. 
Finally, once the robot is done cleaning it will return to the “charging station”.
